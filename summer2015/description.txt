Applied bio-robotics

In this workshop we will explore connections between the biological
and digital domains. The teacher will introduce you to basic
electronics, and helps you building sensors to bridge the
digital/biological gap.

The base of the course are two sample projects. Students use these
projects as inspiration and hack away on them, creating variations or
entirely new installations.

The first project is an installation that connects plants to the
internet, letting the world know when they are in need of water. The
other starter project consists of a DIY microscope which enables
bacteria-driven electronic music.
